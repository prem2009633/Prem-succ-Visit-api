# 🔥 Free Fire 1000 Visit Sender API

This is a Flask-based API that simulates **1000 successful visits** to a Free Fire player's profile using valid access tokens. It decrypts the response using **Protobuf** and returns detailed player information such as UID, nickname, level, likes, region, and visit success/failure stats.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Sends **1000 successful visits** using multiple tokens.
- 🔐 Uses AES-encrypted payloads to match Free Fire's request format.
- 📦 Parses **protobuf** response from Free Fire servers to extract player info.
- 📊 Returns player details: UID, nickname, likes, region, level, success, and fail counts.
- 🔁 Automatically retries until 1000 successful visits are completed.
- 🧠 Token management by region.
- 📄 Clean and JSON-formatted API output.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install flask aiohttp protobuf pycryptodome
  ```

## 🧪 How to Use

1. **Start the Flask server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Make a GET request:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/<server>/<uid>
   ```

   Replace:
   - `<server>` with one of: `IND`, `BR`, `US`, `SAC`, `NA`, `BD`, etc.
   - `<uid>` with the player UID you want to visit.

## 📤 Example Request

```
GET http://localhost:5000/visit?uid=12345678&region=bd
```

---

## 📥 Example Response

```json
{
  "fail": 0,
  "level": 60,
  "likes": 23783,
  "nickname": "—‌Ꮓᴏʙᴀʏᴀʀㅤ모⠏",
  "region": "bd",
  "success": 1000,
  "uid": 1203435801
}
```

---

## ⚙️ Token Format

Each `token_*.json` file should contain a list of tokens in this format:

```json
[
  {"token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_1"},
  {"token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_2"},
  ...
]
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- The system will **keep retrying** until 1000 successful visits are sent.
- If likes or level are not available in the response, they default to `0`.
- If no valid tokens are found, the API will return an error.
- Response is parsed using `.proto` schema and extracted using the `visit_count_pb2.py` module.
